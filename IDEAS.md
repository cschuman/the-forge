# The Forge - Ideas

A collection of scripts and tools to improve my computer efficiency.

## Ideas

### 1. History Analyzer
Parse shell history to find:
- Frequently typed long commands → alias candidates
- Repeated command sequences → script/function candidates
- Commands you always typo → alias corrections
- Time patterns (what do you run at certain times?)

### 2. Disk Scout
Find optimization opportunities:
- Large files/folders you might've forgotten
- Duplicate files
- Old downloads, caches, node_modules graveyards
- Unused applications

### 3. Stale Repo Finder
Find git repos with uncommitted changes or that haven't been touched in months.

### 4. Port Detective
What's running on my ports right now? Quick kill interface.

### 5. Dotfile Auditor
Find config files you've forgotten about, spot inconsistencies.

### 6. Screenshot Graveyard Cleaner
Auto-organize or purge old screenshots.

### 7. Brew Doctor+
Audit homebrew: orphaned packages, outdated stuff, things you installed once and forgot.

### 8. Meeting Prep
One command to quit distracting apps, set Do Not Disturb, open relevant docs.

### 9. Dev Environment Snapshot
Capture what's running/open so you can restore context after a restart.

### 10. WiFi History Logger
Track network performance over time, spot patterns in slow periods.
